# Frontend Mentor - Multi Step Form

Production-ready implementation of the Frontend Mentor Multi-Step Form challenge.

## 🚀 Approach

This project was built using a domain-first architecture with a production discipline mindset:

- Feature-based folder structure
- Step-based validation with Zod
- React Hook Form integration
- Local persistence (localStorage)
- Domain-layer pricing logic
- Unit + integration tests
- CI pipeline
- AI-assisted engineering workflow (see docs/ai-workflow.md)

## 🧠 Engineering Decisions

- No overengineering (no state machine)
- Pure domain logic separated from UI
- Toggle-driven pricing model
- Test coverage for business logic

## 📦 Tech Stack

- Next.js (App Router)
- TypeScript
- Tailwind
- React Hook Form
- Zod
- Jest + React Testing Library

## 🤖 AI Workflow

This project follows a structured AI-assisted development workflow:
